## **Game idk:**

- 2D Sprites in a 3D world/format
- 3rd person / 1st person (?)
- Mechanic:
  - Mirror bob
  - Switch in between bob and pop
    - pop is the realistic bob that lives in the nightmare dimension
      - This dimension is more hell-ish, very weird and compacted BOO :oooo AHHHH, everything in dimension: worn down, broken, etc.
    - bob is the cartoon pop that lives in the cartoon dimension.
      - this dimension is more family friendly, not many weird things happen out of the ordinary (or do they? :))))) )
- Infinity train - Main character wakes up in wagon#1
  - Try to solve puzzles to get to the next wagon
  - First train cartoon-ish and after so much dozen (more or less) cars will enter a room that will suck the player into a realistic and nightmarish train world
  - T. but infinity train (train car doors lock behind you so you must continually loop through the train), things may change on each loop, certain amount of train cars in each loop
  - Some train cars may be different type such as passenger, storage, flatbed
    - Outside the windows may be different universes/theme or something: hell, looks to be outside, total darkness, nightfall in a cornfield, space, underwater,
    -
  - Some train car rooms:
    - Train cars are like different realities, so it does not need to be the size of a normal train car
    - Passenger car → execution house
    - trippy with really bright colors/ flashing effects
    - some normal ones
    - Kitchen → slaughterhouse
    - Park → graveyard
    - Little nightmare but trains (Big room → POV of a mouse)
    - Laboratory (venom symbiote → escapes turns into a monster chases us)
    - For an underwater portion
    - Wall slowly moving in to crush us (Have to move quickly)
    - Chase scene → (POV outside the train at one point? side of train)
    - Car b4 the water portion: it&#39;s a car with windows blacked out, dark room. the door at the end of the car is opened, and you see a wall of water with fish etc swimming past the doorway (cool scene)
    - Water Cart: Looks like a cage. Beautiful scene underwater 20 ft underwater, ---\&gt; cart 5 : darker &amp; deeper → cart 29: no more walls, flush the player off the train (need to put on the deep diving suit before entering water car, you can only walk slowly because of the suit (this will make it much more scary when trying to walk through in the dark or when something scary happens))
      - switches from third person (normal) to first person when you have the suit on, there is a viewing hole on the helmet.
    - Make it so it drops hints that sister was the conductor
    - Theme of the carts needs to reflect on the siblings&#39; background (School carts represent their educational days, pet houses (later turn into a slaughterhouse) represent the day they got their pet for example, etc…)
    - An experience where it looks like you wake up in a full sized house but it ends up being a part of the train
- Puzzles:
  - Maze (just a maze lol) ![](RackMultipart20211027-4-o4g0zs_html_91dca97ff0ba5cf7.png)
  - Riddle puzzles
    - &quot;Why did the duck cross the road&quot; \&gt;\&gt; &quot;He never actually made it across…&quot; Passenger&#39;s eyes and face begin to glitch out.
  - Tic Tac Toe
  - Find similarity or logic problem, something cryptic \&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;
  - Math problems _**(VINCENT)**_ **:)**
  - Cooking puzzle for kitchen room
  - Park could be a treasure map puzzle (normal train will just have bob have fun with a kid looking for a treasure, on the other side of the train, pop will be digging up a dead body)
  - Find the passenger&#39;s head: You find the passenger headless, but for some reason there is still dialog, (one of the first creepy things out of the ordinary inside the cartoon dimension), you must go through the train cars and find his head and return it. Once you see his head trippy or backwards music, ambient sounds begin playing (supposed to be a trippy experience idk), it ends up being a hyper realistic head (does not match the cartoon artstyle at all (maybe even 3D)) and you put it on him regardless.

**Scope of project for Game Jam:**

- Make the game playable at least
  - 4 cartoon rooms (the 4th being really simple: the mirror room)
    - some hints of freaky stuff
    - small puzzle in each room
      - You have to find and switch 2 levers to unlock the door to the next car
      -
  - At the end of the 4th cartoon room you see a mirror leaking the nightmare dimension into the cartoon dimension.
    - You get sucked into the mirror and enter the nightmare dimension
  - 4 nightmare rooms where it is freaky as fuck Yee haw dawg
    - the 4th room being a mirror room again. You get transported back to the cartoon world, and the mirror breaks so that nothing can get back through.
- Make textures for:
  - Train car
    - walls
    - ceiling
    - floor
    - chair
    - door
  - General Textures 2D
    - Dialog text box? For the character&#39;s thoughts
    - Lever or button
    - Mirror (2w x 5h - like size)
    - Crate (only need 1 face, can copy it to the other sides)
    - Suitcase
  - Environment textures (outside the train
    - A loop for sky outside the windows (for the cartoon world it can be just clouds going by)
