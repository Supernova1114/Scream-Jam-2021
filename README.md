## About
<table>
<tr>
<td>
  
Originally a Scream jam project but we missed the deadline so it turned into a full project ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  
Scream jams are horror-themed game jams made to encourage devs to get their spook on! From straight-up scares to interactive fiction and roleplaying games, scream jams encourage all creators to try making something spooky every few months, often based upon an optional theme or season.
